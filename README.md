### Description

Culinary Quest is my first project, serving as a recipe website that allows users to explore a wide range of recipes retrieved from the Spoonacular API. The site offers intuitive filtering through various criteria like cuisines, diet types, nutritional considerations, meals, and more. Each recipe comes with step-by-step instructions, a list of required ingredients, and comprehensive nutritional information. A convenient search feature helps users quickly find recipes of interest, and the ability to (locally) favorite recipes adds a personal touch.
